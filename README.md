## Description
   

This project was a collaborative effort by our team to develop a recipe application that empowers users to share, rate, and discover their favorite recipes online. Leveraging a modern tech stack, our app is built with Express.js for the backend, using Nodemon for development convenience, Sequelize for database management, and Helmet.js for enhancing security. We've deployed the app to Heroku for easy access and used MySQL2 for database handling. With this app, we aim to provide a seamless experience for food enthusiasts to explore a world of culinary delights. Bon app√©tit!

    
## Installation   
    simply git clone the files into your IDE. 
    Then seed the database. 
    run the program using npx server command. 

## Usage
    

This README serves as a guide for setting up, running, and understanding our recipe app project. It provides information on installation, configuration, and usage, ensuring a seamless experience for developers and users.

## Testing Requirements
   
Project testing needs: Here is a list of things we can continue to manually test to ensure the website is working properly...

Unit Testing: We're yet to perform unit tests using libraries like Mocha and Chai to evaluate code components, including route handlers, controllers, and utility functions, ensuring they work correctly in isolation.

Integration Testing: Pending integration tests using Supertest and Mocha to verify different app parts work together seamlessly.

End-to-End Testing: We'll use tools like Cypress for end-to-end testing to simulate user interactions and ensure the app functions as expected.

Security Testing: We'll conduct security tests, including setting HTTP security headers with Helmet.js and identifying/addressing vulnerabilities like XSS or SQL Injection.

Database Testing: We need to validate database queries and interactions using Sequelize's testing utilities for accurate data storage and retrieval.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): We plan to conduct UAT sessions with real users for feedback on app usability.

Deployment Testing: Before deploying to Heroku, we'll perform thorough testing in a staging environment for smooth production-like operation.
